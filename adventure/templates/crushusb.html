<title>Crush USB</title>

You drop the USB and stomp on it multiple times. You find a hammer and
continue to smash it repeatedly until the usb is in tiny unusable bits and
the tracker is permanently damaged.

<p>You are filled with relief, but thinking longer, you feel unsatisfied.
<p>You will never know what was on that USB drive and this question will
  haunt you forever.

<p> The "Unsatisfactory" End
