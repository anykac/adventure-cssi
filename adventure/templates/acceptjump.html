You push the accept button and the car exploded. You flew out of the car seat
and faceplanted at 34 mph into the ground. For four hours, you laid on the ground.
Blurry images of tacos clouded your vision. You began to wonder why no one has
come to help you yet. Suddenly, you heard strange voices but they began to move away.
<p>Maybe you should try calling out.
<ul>
  <li>Call out for help</li>
  <li>Laid down and wait</li>
</ul>
